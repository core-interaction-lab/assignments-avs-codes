        <h2>what if spotify let you make a random playlist where you could control how popular the artists are?</h2>

        <p>my story aims to imagine a situation where spotify lets you create a playlist and automatically add songs to it. the user would be able to control a lot of parameters from this such as the artists having under a certain number of monthly listeners or originating from a certain country. the idea is that it would allow users to explore and discover new artists according to the criteria they set and hopefully help out lesser known artists as well.</p>

        <p>just a little bit of background to help of you get started but a feature of spotify is that artists can see the playlist names of some of the playlists their songs get added to.</p>
